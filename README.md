About the game:

The game works like any other snake game. 

To move the snake you have to use the arrow keys.

There are 2 types of apples you can consume/eat.

The red apple makes your snake 1 tick longer and adds +1 point to your score.

The golden apple makes your snake 3 ticks longer and adds +3 points to your score.

We have deployed sound when the snake eats an apple or dies.
Under construction: background musik during playtime.
