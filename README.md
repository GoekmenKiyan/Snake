***About the game:***

- The game works like any other snake game. 
  - Instead of a Main Menu there is a sidebar with buttons
- To move the snake you have to use the arrow keys.
- There are 2 types of apples you can consume/eat.
- The red apple makes your snake 1 tick longer and adds +1 point to your score.
- The golden apple makes your snake 3 ticks longer and adds +3 points to your score.
